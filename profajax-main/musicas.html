        <P>
            On a cobweb afternoon<BR>
In a room full of emptiness<BR>
By a freeway I confess<BR>
I was lost in the pages<BR>
Of a book full of death<BR>
Reading how we'll die alone<BR>
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest<BR>
Anywhere we want to go<BR>
In your house, I long to be<BR>
Room by room, patiently<BR>
I'll wait for you there<BR>
Like a stone<BR>
I'll wait for you there Alone<BR>
And on my deathbed I will pray<BR>
To the gods and the angels<BR>
Like a pagan to anyone<BR>
Who will take me to heaven<BR>
To a place I recall<BR>
I was there so long ago<BR>
The sky was bruised<BR>
The wine was bled<BR>
And there you led me on<BR>
In your house, I long to be<BR>
Room by room, patiently<BR>
I'll wait for you there<BR>
Like a stone<BR>
I'll wait for you there<BR>
Alone<BR>
Alone<BR>
And on I read<BR>
Until the day was gone<BR>
And I sat in regret<BR>
Of all the things I've done<BR>
For all that I've blessed<BR>
And all that I've wronged<BR>
In dreams until my death<BR>
I will wander on<BR>
In your house, I long to be<BR>
Room by room, patiently<BR>
I'll wait for you there<BR>
Like a stone<BR>
I'll wait for you there
Alone<BR>
Alone<BR>
        </P>

    <p>
        Once upon a time I was of the mind<br>
        To lay your burden down<br>
        And leave you where you stood<br>
        And you believed I could<br>
        You'd seen it done before<br>
        I could read your thoughts<br>
        Tell you what you saw<br>
        And never say a word<br>
        Now all that is gone<br>
        Over with and done, never to return<br>
        I can tell you why<br>
        People die alone<br>
        I can tell you I'm<br>
        A shadow on the sun<br>
        Staring at the loss<br>
        Looking for a cause<br>
        And never really sure<br>
        Nothing but a hole<br>
        To live without a soul<br>
        And nothing to be learned<br>
        I can tell you why<br>
        People go insane<br>
        I can show you how<br>
        You could do the same<br>
        I can tell you why<br>
        The end will never come<br>
        I can tell you I'm<br>
        A shadow on the sun<br>
        Shapes of every size<br>
        Move behind my eyes<br>
        Doors inside my head<br>
        Bolted from within<br>
        Every drop of flame<br>
        Lights a candle in<br>
        Memory of the one<br>
        Who lives inside my skin<br>
        I can tell you why<br>
        People go insane<br>
        I can show you how<br>
        You could do the same<br>
        I can tell you why<br>
        The end will never come<br>
        I can tell you I'm<br>
        A shadow on the sun<br>
        Shadow on the sun, shadow on the sun<br>
        Shadow on the sun, shadow on the sun<br>
        Shadow on the sun, shadow on the sun<br>
        Shadow on the sun, shadow on the sun<br>
        Sun, sun<br>

        Psychic spies from China<br>
Try to steal your mind's elation<br>
And little girls from Sweden<br>
Dream of silver-screen quotation<br>
And if you want these kind of dreams<br>
It's Californication<br>

It's the edge of the world<br>
And all of Western civilization<br>
The Sun may rise in the East<br>
At least it settled in a final location<br>
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication<br>

Pay your surgeon very well<br>
To break the spell of aging<br>
Celebrity skin: Is this your chin<br>
Or is that war you're waging?<br>

First born unicorn<br>
Hardcore soft porn<br>

Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world<br>
Be my very own constellation<br>
A teenage bride with a baby inside<br>
Getting high on information<br>
And buy me a star on the boulevard<br>
It's Californication<br>

Space may be the final frontier<br>
But it's made in a Hollywood basement<br>
And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres<br>
Singing songs off Station to Station?<br>
And Alderaan's not far away<br>
It's Californication<br>

Born and raised by those who praise<br>
Control of population<br>
Well, everybody's been there<br>
And I don't mean on vacation<br>

First born unicorn<br>
Hardcore soft porn<br>

Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>
Dream of Californication<br>

Destruction leads to a very rough road<br>
But it also breeds creation<br>
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar<br>
They're just another good vibration<br>
And tidal waves couldn't save the world<br>
From Californication<br>

Pay your surgeon very well<br>
To break the spell of aging<br>
Sicker than the rest, there is no test<br>
But this is what you're craving<br>

First born unicorn<br>
Hardcore soft porn<br>
